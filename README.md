The project involves building ARIMA and SARIMA models for short- and long-term forecasting of NVIDIA stock prices, incorporating technical indicators such as RSI, SMA/EMA, and MACD for improved predictive accuracy and investment decision-making.

An LSTM neural network was deployed to forecast NVIDIA stock price volatility, achieving a 15% reduction in prediction error compared to traditional ARIMA models, thus enhancing investment decision-making.
